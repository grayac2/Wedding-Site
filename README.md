### How do I get set up? ###

This application runs on ASP .NET Core 1.1

It should come with all required components. The only setup should be the database. This application uses a code-first approach, so to set it up, an update needs to be applied to the database. It is configured to set up a local database, but if you would like to direct it to a database elsewhere, you can modify the appsettings.json file.
The commands to use in the Package Manager Console are as follows:
Update-Database
